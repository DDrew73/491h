# ECE 491H: Fundamentals of Robotics and Cyberphysical Systems
**Instructor:** Dr. Daniel Drew, Assistant Professor, Electrical Engineering\
**Course Meets:** Mo/We 3:30pm - 4:45pm, KUY 306

**Course Summary:**\
This 3-credit course will cover fundamental concepts related to the sensing, actuation, signal processing, and control mechanisms underlying robots and other intelligent physical systems.<br><br> Robots and other connected devices with the ability to physically interact with the world around them are transforming the world. The study of these systems is inherently interdisciplinary, and working on them effectively requires both a broad skillset and the ability to think about end-to-end systems holistically. This course is divided into three overarching modules: sensing, actuation, and intelligence. Each module will contain detail about both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical implementation of the topic material. Every class will include hands-on experience with electronic components and an embedded microcontroller, building the requisite tools over the course of the semester for a final project where you will program an autonomous robot in a class competition.<br><br> Specific topics of study include: transduction principles of common sensors and actuators, basic circuits and principles for the interfacing of sensors and actuators with embedded microcontrollers, microcontroller architecture concepts, introductory-level digital signal processing including intelligent thresholding, low- and high-pass filters, introductory feedback control principles including PID, and machine learning concepts like neural networks. 

For more information, please see [the course syllabus](readings/reading1/syllabus.md).

Note that this is a **live site**; I will be adding Readings and Labs module blocks, and enabling links within modules, as we go through the course. This helps me adjust pacing and content to better fit our progress.
