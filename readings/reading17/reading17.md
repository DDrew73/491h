## Encoders
Encoders are essential components in motion control systems, providing feedback on position, speed, or direction of a mechanical component. By converting mechanical movement into electrical signals, encoders enable precise monitoring and control in applications ranging from robotics and CNC machines to automotive systems and industrial automation. Whether using optical, magnetic, or capacitive sensing technologies, encoders ensure accuracy and reliability in tasks that require detailed feedback, making them indispensable in modern electromechanical systems.
