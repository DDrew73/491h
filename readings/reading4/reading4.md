## Analog-to-Digital Conversion

This reading assignment is intended to serve as an introduction to one of the most important peripherals in robotics and cyberphysical systems contexts, the analog-to-digital converter. Although hopefully the reading on voltage dividers is review, this is a critical circuit topology that is worth memorizing.

**Reading Material:**
- [Art of Electronics - Conversion](assets/ArtOfElectronics_Conversion.pdf) (~3 pages)
- [ADCs (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnfjYwe2A0w) ~7 min
- [Practical Electronics for Inventors - ADCs](assets/PracticalElectronics_ADC.pdf) (~2 pages)
- [Art of Electronics - ADCs](assets/ArtOfElectronics_ADC.pdf) (~3 pages)
- [Practical Electronics for Inventors - Voltage Dividers](assets/PracticalElectronics_VoltDivider.pdf)) ~1.5 pages

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Be able to describe the high-level function of an analog-to-digital converter
- Understand what bit resolution means for an ADC
- Understand how to convert the binary output of an ADC to its input voltage
- Understand a voltage divider circuit and be able to perform nodal analysis on it
