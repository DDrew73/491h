## MEMS Sensors

A variety of physical phenomena have favorable scaling laws for miniaturization. Forces in both the electromagnetic (e.g., electrostatic, magnetic) and fluid dynamic (e.g., surface tension) domains benefit greatly from the high surface area-to-volume ratio of small devices, for example. Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) as a term actually originated in a proposal from the University of Utah (Dr. Drew's prior institution) to DARPA (see below) in 1986.

DARPA would later champion the development of MEMS throughout the 90s and 2000s, until successful commercial ventures spinning out of that research turned MEMS into a multi-billion dollar industry. Dr. Drew did his PhD with a MEMS focus at UC Berkeley, so he knows a lot about this topic-- ask him!
