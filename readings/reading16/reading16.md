## Motor Driver Circuits: The H Bridge
The H-Bridge is a fundamental circuit configuration used to control the direction and speed of DC motors. By manipulating the current flow through the motor, the H-Bridge enables forward, reverse, and braking capabilities, making it a versatile solution for motor control in robotics and a huge range of other areas. Even stepper motors, which have seemingly a much more complicated mode of operation, are usually driven by a bunch of H-bridges working in tandem!
