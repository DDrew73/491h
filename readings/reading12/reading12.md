## DC Motors

In modern electromechanical systems, actuators play a crucial role in converting electrical energy into physical motion. Among the most widely used are DC motors, which are found in everything from household appliances to robotics. Despite their simple design, they offer precise control over speed and direction, making them ideal for applications where accuracy and responsiveness are key. Understanding how DC motors work, their types, and how they can be controlled is fundamental to designing effective systems, especially in microcontroller-based setups and other embedded applications.
