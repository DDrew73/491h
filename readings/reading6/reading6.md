## Transduction Principles

The core purpose of most cyberphysical systems is to transduce (convert) some form of environmental stimulus into digital information. The specifics -- how we measure these stimuli, how we convert sensor readings to electrical signals that are readable by a microcontroller, and how we turn those electrical signals into digital data (1s and 0s) -- is what I hope you can get a strong sense for by the end of this "Sensing" module. The first step is to learn about some basic transduction principles, and how we use transducers in sensors. 

**Reading Material:**
- [Practical Electronics for Inventors - Transduction](assets/PracticalElectronics_Transducers.pdf) (~4 pages, mostly images)
- [Sensors Vs Transducers (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJfzQw4bovc) ~4 min
- [Characteristics of Sensed Signals](assets/RobotSensors.pdf) (~7 pages, mostly images)

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Be able to list some common sensors along with the environmental stimulus they are designed to sense
- Understand the principle and working operation of the transduction pathway from common stimuli to digital data
- Understand the high level difference between a transducer and a sensor
- Learn some common methods for talking about sensor outputs

**Supplemental Material:**
- [Sensors - Big Video of Examples (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlG6LY84MUU) ~17 minutes
- [Slideshow on robot sensors and actuators](assets/RobotSensors_Slides.pdf) ~70 slides!
