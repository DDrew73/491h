## Other Important Actuators
Solenoids and stepper motors are fundamental components in electromechanical systems that require linear or rotational motion control. Solenoids, known for their simple design, provide quick and powerful linear actuation, making them ideal for applications like locking mechanisms and valves. Stepper motors, on the other hand, offer precise control over rotational movement, breaking down a full rotation into discrete steps, which is critical in applications like 3D printing, CNC machines, and robotics.
