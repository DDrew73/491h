## PID Controllers
The PID controller is ubiquitous, especially for control of robotic actuators. Although fancy machine learning-based controllers might be functioning at a higher level—object recognition, task and motion planning, etc.—even then, there are typically embedded PID controllers taking care of low-level functionality. These controllers handle precise control tasks like maintaining motor speeds, stabilizing arm positions, or managing force exerted by actuators. 

**Reading Material:**

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Be able to explain the high level function of a PID controller, and define the three components
- Be able to qualitatively describe the effects of each of the P, I, and D components on output behavior
