## Pulse Width Modulation

In the previous reading, we learned about Digital-To-Analog conversion and some applications where it is common. In practice, however, pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are used much more frequently to approximate analog outputs. Whether it's controlling the brightness of an LED, the speed of a motor, or the rate a battery charges, PWM is ubiquitous modern cyber-physical systems.
