## The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is vital in robotics and cyberphysical systems for efficiently analyzing signals and data in the frequency domain. The reading today is just two videos; the 3B1B video is one of my absolute favorites, and should hopefully give you a conceptual understanding of the Fourier transform. The second is a real demo of implementing the FFT in Python. As you'll see, actually "understanding" the Fourier transform in a mathematical sense is almost irrelevant, because most of the (easy) things you will do with it are straightforward given numpy or scipy.

**Reading Material:**
- [But what is the Fourier Transform? 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&t=1s&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) ~20 min
- [FFT in Python, Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Y8FChBaFU&ab_channel=1Mviews) ~14 min


**Learning Outcomes:**
- Be able to describe the function of the Fourier transform
- Be able to describe the basic implementation of an FFT in Python
