## Servo Motors

Servo motors are essential components in systems that require precise position control, often seen in robotics, automation, and remote-controlled mechanisms. Unlike standard DC motors, servos provide both position and speed feedback, allowing for more accurate control. With their ability to hold a position based on input signals, servo motors are critical for tasks like steering mechanisms, robotic arms, and other precision applications. A strong understanding of how servo motors function, their internal feedback mechanisms, and how to control them is key to mastering motion control in embedded systems.
