## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM, is the problem of building a map of an unknown environment by a mobile robot while at the same time navigating the environment using the map. SLAM generally consists of multiple parts; landmark extraction, data association, state estimation, state update and landmark update. There are many, many ways to solve each of the smaller parts!  The wikipedia page is actually very useful for an overview of different approaches: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping
