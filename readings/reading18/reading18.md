## Feedback Control Overview
Feedback control makes the world go round! Understanding the basics of feedback control methodology is critical for your career as an engineer, regardless of whether you work with robots. At its core, feedback control is about monitoring outputs and adjusting inputs to meet desired system behaviors. This principle is applied in countless fields, from automotive systems maintaining speed and stability, to heating and cooling systems regulating temperature, to sophisticated industrial processes ensuring product quality. By continuously measuring and adjusting, feedback control systems improve efficiency, accuracy, and reliability, forming the backbone of modern engineering solutions.
