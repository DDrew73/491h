## Distance Sensors

By measuring range to obstacles and surfaces, distance sensors enable safe navigation, collision avoidance, mapping (SLAM), and precise manipulation and docking. In control loops, continuous distance feedback lets systems maintain standoff, follow contours, and enforce safety margins under uncertainty. Different modalities, like LiDAR, ultrasonic, stereo/structured light, and radar, offer complementary ranges, resolutions, and robustness, which can be fused to improve reliability across environments.
