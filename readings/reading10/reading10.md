## Distance Sensors

In increasingly interconnected systems which must traffic data between multiple on-board processors and sensors, and even services in the cloud, robust digital communication protocols are vital -- consider the world-changing power of WiFi, and the buzz of 5G technology. But there is a core of more fundamental, low-level protocols which underpin many systems. These slower, simpler protocols are extremely common for IOT devices and microcontroller-based subcomponents of larger cyberphysical systems.
