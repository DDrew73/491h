## Digital Communication Protocols

In increasingly interconnected systems which must traffic data between multiple on-board processors and sensors, and even services in the cloud, robust digital communication protocols are vital -- consider the world-changing power of WiFi, and the buzz of 5G technology. But there is a core of more fundamental, low-level protocols which underpin many systems. These slower, simpler protocols are extremely common for IOT devices and microcontroller-based subcomponents of larger cyberphysical systems.

**Reading Material:**
- [UART, I2C, and SPI Protocols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyGwvGzrqp8) ~12 min
- [An Introduction to I2C and SPI Protocols](assets/i2c_spi_intro.pdf) ~5 pages
- [I2C vs SPI Pros Cons and Use Cases](https://www.wevolver.com/article/i2c-vs-spi-protocols-differences-pros-cons-use-cases)

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand the working principles of a digital communication protocol
- Understand the differences between the UART, I2C, and SPI communication protocols

**Supplemental Material:**
- [Bit Banging I2C](https://calcium3000.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/i2c-bit-banging-tutorial-part-i/) <br>Re-implementing I2C, or at least reading how someone else would do it, is an interesting way to understand it on a deeper level.
