## Sensor Readout Circuits

This reading focuses on the essential circuits used to accurately read and amplify sensor signals. You will explore the role of operational amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers in sensor interfaces, and understand the principles behind the essential and ubiquitous Wheatstone Bridge circuit for precise measurement of resistance changes. The material provides a foundation for designing circuits that convert sensor outputs into usable data for further processing.
